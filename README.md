# birbSnail

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was 'Stained Glass'.

Bit of a simple one this week but works fine. Like it's a nice enough idea but I haven't really got anything here that I've not used before. 

# Blender Bit.
- Terrible rushed model.
- Don't look to closely at the floor.
- While experimenting with lighting baked a texture that was super washed out but kinda cool.
- Ended up using it as an alternate thats triggered when you click the title.
- Nice when accidents kinda work out.


# Three Bit.
- Not really anything interesting happening here tbh
- Store the bits of the model you want to be clickable in an array and then use the [Three.js Raycaster](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Raycaster)

# Shader bit.
- My standard throw Math.random() into the uniforms and call it generative.
- [Heavy use of Char Stiles pModPolar]( http://charstiles.com/shader/)
- TBH I often owe a debt to stuff from Char, always worth watching or listening to.


#Other
- [Very cool and useful Font](https://www.dafont.com/artdystopia-ii.font)
- Initially was gonna go for a Sunn O))) midi but I guess thats mainly just one long note so decided against it.
- Really if you're gonna go metal for a joke you should reach for Slayer.
- So I reached for Slayer.
